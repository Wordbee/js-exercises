# Fizz Buzz

Write a program that console logs the numbers from 1 to n. But:

- For multiples of 3 print “fizz” instead of the number
- For the multiples of 5 prints “buzz”.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”.

For example:

Running:

```js
fizzBuzz(5);
```

Will console log

```
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
```
